I'm a multi-line comment in javascript 

1. Variables 
2. Functions 
3. Conditionals 
4. Loops


Pseudo-Code 

discount_code = 0.55
show discount_code
discount_code*5

1. variables give us two things: 

- fewer errors
- consistent values (also helps new team members)

------------------

2. Functions are self contained blocks of code that are re-useable  

priceInCart = 25
priceInCart * (1-discount_code)

function findDiscount () {
priceInCart * (1-discount_code)

}
-----------------

3. Conditionals are a way to choose between different paths based on a condition.  

If something, then something, otherwise
if there are apples, then I buy apples. 
Otherwise, I buy oranges. 

If it's in stock <- condition (conditional)
Then add to cart <- yes!
Otherwise show a message to say "out of stock" <- no :(


4. Looping is used to repeat a set of instructions over and over again. 

For 10 times
For every item in their cart 

Problem: Write code for NestThermstat in the Winter

getCurrentTemp
getUserPeferredTemp

1. What temp do we want?
2. What temp is it right now? 

getCurrentTemp // what is the room at right now 


while thermostat is on
preferredTemp = getUserPreferredTemp()
currentTemp: getCurrentTemp

IF preferredTemp > currentTemp
THEN turn_on_heater
OTHERWSISE turn_off_heater

preferredTemp/currentTemp are variables 
conditional for the IF


-------
You can get a specific element by typing it into the console. for an ID it will return a div
